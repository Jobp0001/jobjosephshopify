                    <p style="padding-top: 190px;">Chronos is an app created to organize time, keep track of events and shifts.
                    As students who worked part time at multiple places, we needed something to organise time than just reminders and notes.That is how I started working on an app with my friend. But the project that started out as a simple idea (not that simple) became a more complex project. I done the User Interface and User Experience Design for the App.</p>
                    
                    <p style="padding-top: 40px;">This project was a very intenze learning experience for me. Collaborating with a friend learning new aspects of UI/UX design each day.</p>

                    <p style="padding-top: 190px;">The initial research was done on the data we are dealing with. And it was complex. A hourly paid part time job doesnt follow the same schedule for a long time. Shift hours can change everyday. SOmetimes you work an extra shift, swap a shift with a friend. Take leave, take a half day leave or might just start or stop in a difference of few hours. So the challenge was to make a clear picture of the data we are dealing with and how it can be classified for a sytematic appraoch.</p>
                    
                    <p style="padding-top: 80px;">Initially we worked with the data that was available or what we knew. Which was to consider our own data. But soon the the data complexity increased and so we decided to consider two sources that are not just hypothetical scenarious. So we began collecting actual data.</p>

                 <p  style="padding-top: 150px;">We came to know that OC Transpo workers still use pen and paper to organise their time. So we collected some of their schedules, and time division data through a friend. At this point we had some fresh data to consider and our project took a turn. We had some real numbers to play with and real scenarious or issues to consider. </p>
                 
                  
                 <p  style="padding-top: 140px;">Plus we had a lot of students around us. Who worked as part timers and we asked a lot of them about how they organised their time. What was the most common difficulty they faced. Where they already using an app for personal management. And if so what can we bring new to the appstore. </p>

                 <p  style="padding-top: 60vh;">Once we had all the nessecary data, I started to work on the User Interface.Initially I created basic scribbles and flowcharts to help picturise the complex data as visual elements. At each stage I tried to create the most minimal visual aspect for a specific information. I wanted to create a calnder that was different and helpful to users to read from and enter information into.Then I took the idea to create some simple wireframes.</p>

                 <p  style="padding-top: 190px;">This is a key feature of Chronus that I made as a useful visual element for users. We called it the Tetris View because once we made a prototype and swiped back and fourth through the calender pages the changing patterns looked like the famous Tetris Game. </p>
                 
                 <p  style="padding-top: 190px;">The shapes or patterns that are formed communicate to the user. It is always used to compare two types of information like - Working hours and free hours. For intance for a man who needs to know whether he has more working days or leave in the coming months. All he needs to do is swipe. The man can simly get an idea about his working hours in a glance instead of counting days in the boring calnder. </p>
